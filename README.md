An incomplete, unofficial Python package to interface with [SAIL Databank](https://saildatabank.com)'s database, supported by a C++20 backend.


## Project plan

### ODBC & DBI
- Attempt to conform to [PEP 249](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/)
- Assess feasibility of using `nanodbc` as `ODBC` backend, or whether a handmade solution would be more perfomant - a C-side implementation of thread safe connection pooling might also be a nice addition

### Performance of Py/C API
- Utilise [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) for data access and to support batched data transfer to Python

### Utilities
- Handmade [DotEnv](https://dotenvx.com/docs/env-file) parser to aid user(s) in managing their workspace alongside profile & secret management
